SideProject

During the COVID-19 pandemic,

I integrated Linebot with my backend so that my colleagues could check current stock prices.

Subsequently, I added docker, CICD, and integrated ChatGPT functionality.

Technologies : python / linebot / OpenAI / docker / Nginx / Jenkins / AWS-EC2 (close now) / crawler / devops build / microservices

Functions : get the newest PTT links / linebot / check current stock prices / ChatGPT
